          <p>Hi, welcome to my C programminng page. Here you can learn about what possibilities this language contains.</p>
          <div class="boxed"><code>printf("Hello, World!");</code></div>
          <p>Most importantly, I would like to mention that the C language is the foundation of languages like C# and C++.</p>

          <p>The C language is not a hard one to learn, however, it teaches core fundamentals to the new programmer.</p>

            <h2>Functions</h2>
          </header>
          <p>C functions aren't as simple as some think. The way a beginner programmer would make one is by creating it inside<br> of the main function of the program, however this isn't the most proper way to do it.</p>
          <p>The way to create a proper function is by making it outside of the main function, then calling it into the main function.<br>The first way this is done is via <b>"Call by Value"</b>. This way takes the intial value and makes copies of it but
            does not
            <br>overall change that value.<br></p>
          <div class="boxed"><code>/* function definition to swap the values */<br>
void swap(int x, int y)<br> {
   int temp;<br>
   temp = x; /* save the value of x */<br>
   x = y;    /* put y into x */<br>
   y = temp; /* put temp into y */<br> 
   return;
          }</code></div>
          <p>After <b>"Call by Value"</b> The other important method for functions is call by reference. <b>"Call by Reference"</b> takes the original<br>value, and modifies it instead of making a copy. This is generally the harder action to perform and
            is not used as much as<br><b>"Call by Value"</b>. You will notice the use of the <b>"*"</b>. This is used to reference which variables need to be ran through the function.</p>
          <div class="boxed"><code>/* function definition to swap the values */<br>
void swap(int *x, int *y)<br> {
   int temp;<br>
   temp = *x;  /* save the value at address x */<br>
   *x = *y;      /* put y into x */<br>
   *y = temp;    /* put temp into y */<br>
  
   return;
}</code></div>

            <h2>Arrays</h2>
          </header>
          <p>A huge role in almost all programming languages including C, arrays are a piece of programming everyone should learn.</p>
          <div class="boxed"><code>type arrayName [ arraySize ];
</code></div>
          <p>An array is a kind of data structure that can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. Its used <br>to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of
            the same type.<br>The output of an array will typically look like a list, and will usually start at 0.</p>
          <div class="boxed"><code>
            Element[0] = 100<br> Element[1] = 101<br> Element[2] = 102<br> Element[3] = 103<br> Element[4] = 104<br> Element[5] = 105<br> Element[6] = 106<br> Element[7] = 107<br> Element[8] = 108<br> Element[9] = 109</code></div>

      <div id="IfElse">
        <section id="If_Else_Statements" class="main-section">
          <header>
            <h2>If Else Statements</h2>
          </header>
          <p>If else statements open up alot of doors to give programs logic. Logic lets programmers keep their programs from making <br>errors as well as opening up other options for users to make.<br></p>
          <div class="boxed"><code>if(boolean_expression) { <br>
   /* statement(s) will execute if the boolean expression is true */
<br>} <br>else {
   /* statement(s) will execute if the boolean expression is false */
<br>}</code></div>
          <p>The <b>"If Else"</b> statement is seen in every other language in their own form of the function. withouht it, programs would have<br> many holes and issues.</p>
          <div class="boxed"><code>/* local variable definition */<br>
   int a = 100;<br>
   /* check the boolean condition */<br>
   if( a < 20 ) {
      <br>/* if condition is true then print the following */
      printf("a is less than 20\n" );<br>
   } else {<br>
      /* if condition is false then print the following */<br>
      printf("a is not less than 20\n" );
   }
   
   <br>printf("value of a is : %d\n", a);
 
            <br> return 0;</code></div>
